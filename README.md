# Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
+ Creating AWS S3 Buckets, Uploading & Downloading objects programmatically.
+ Multi-part File Transfer & Generating Pre-signed URLS.
+ Setting up Bucket Policies & CORS configuration.

By the end of this course, you will be able to create, modify, manage, share objects in an AWS S3 bucket programmatically using Python.
Course Structure

This course is divided into 3 parts:
+ Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
+ Working with AWS S3 buckets using Python & boto3: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
+ Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
